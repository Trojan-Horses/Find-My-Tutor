# Project 1 - Find-My-Tutor

Find My Tutor is a simple app to make it easy for students to find a tutor near them. Both the student and tutor will sign up , hopefully via facebook. They then create their profile. The students can view a tutor for a required subject nearby then. They can then send request for a tutor and if the tutor accepts the request ,they agree on a location and payment. For tutor, there will be special FindMyTutor button which if is turned on will make them available for tutoring .
